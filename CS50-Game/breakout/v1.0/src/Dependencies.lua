-- push is a library that will allow us to draw our game at a virtual
-- resolution, instead of however large our window is; used to provide
-- a more retro aesthetic

-- the "Class" library we're using will allow us to represent anything in
-- our game as code, rather than keeping track of many disparate variables and
-- methods
